## Implementation of RC4 algorithm in python. 

**RC4 (also known as Rivest Cipher 4) is a form of stream cipher. It encrypts messages one byte at a time via an algorithm.**

**RC4 relies on:**
1. ```Key inputs. This tool generates an eight-bit number (cipher) that's impossible to guess. ```
2. ```Keystreams. The cipher scrambles plain text. ```
3. ```Product. An X-OR operation combines the keystream with the cipher. ```
